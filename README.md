# Drug predition system
 
In this project, Drug Type Using Machine Learning Techniques is a solution designed to identify the types of
drugs that can be used to treat a disease. The built Python GUI allows the user to visualize the various drugs
after entering the symptoms into the GUI. The drug is displayed after the decision tree Machine learning
algorithm evaluates the symptoms entered.
